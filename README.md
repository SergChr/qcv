## Use cases
#### Keeping a JSON resume in Git
The tool allows to have one JSON file where the resume information placed. It can be stored in a `git` repository to make the updating process more seamless. There could be branching applied for different versions; the diffs are more simpler to track.
No more `CV_1.pdf`, `CV_1_updated.pdf`, `CV_1_updated_for_facebook.pdf`.

#### Controlling and keeping track of the information
No need to move between different services that generate a resume or/and store it.

#### Generating a simple portfolio website
The tool generates a HTML file based on a HTML template that can be customized.

## How does it work
The tool replaces variables in a HTML template (see `src/assets/themes`) with corresponding values in the JSON template. Example:
This is a HTML template
```html
<div>{{basics.name}}<div>
```
The JSON template is
```json
{
    "basics": {
        "name": "John Doe"
    }
}
```
So the result will be as follows:
```html
<div>John Doe</div>
```
#### Formatting rules
##### cv.json
This is the JSON template example below. It will be generated by the `init` command. It creates `cv.json` file with the similar content:
```json
{
    "basics": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "label": "Programmer",
      "email": "john@gmail.com",
      "phone": "(912) 555-4321",
      "website": "http://johndoe.com",
      "summary": "A brief summary on who I am",
      "location": {
        "country": "The Johnited States Of Doe",
        "address": "2712 Broadway St",
        "city": "San Francisco"
      },
      "profiles": [{
        "network": "Twitter",
        "username": "john",
        "url": "http://twitter.com/john"
      }]
    },
    "work": [{
      "company": "Company",
      "position": "President",
      "website": "http://company.com",
      "start_date": "2013-01-01",
      "end_date": "2014-01-01",
      "summary": "Description..."
    }],
    "projects": [{
      "name": "An app to track time",
      "description": "A web and mobile application that allowed 2500 people to track their working time"
    }],
    "education": [{
      "institution": "University",
      "area": "Software Development",
      "study_type": "Bachelor",
      "start_date": "2011-01-01",
      "end_date": "2013-01-01",
      "courses": [
        "DB1101 - Basic SQL"
      ],
      "location": "Washington DC, US"
    }],
    "skills": [{ "name": "Web Development" }],
    "languages": [{
      "language": "English",
      "level": "Native speaker"
    }]
  }
```
Put your information into this file. Then use the `build simple` command to generate the `cv.html` output.

## Available themes
Usage:
```sh
$ qcv build <theme_name>
# See theme names below
# e.g. qcv build simple
```
#### Simple
![Simple](/src/assets/themes/simple/simple.png "Simple")

#### Highway
![Highway](/src/assets/themes/highway/highway.png "Highway")

## Custom HTML themes
There is an ability to build your custom HTML template and generate a resume from it. Example:
```sh
$ qcv build-from my_theme.html
```
#### Formatting rules for the HTML templates
_As a reference, you could use "simple" theme (`src/assets/themes/simple/index.html`)._
##### Primitive/simple values
A value inside `{{ root_key }}` in a HTML template looks up for a key `root_key` in the `cv.json` file and replaces `{{ root_key }}` with the corresponding value. Nested keys should be written as `{{ root.nested.more_nested }}`. Say, we have the following `cv.json`:
```json
{
    "basics": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "label": "Programmer",
    },
}
```
A theme could be:
```html
<section id="main-info">
    <h1>{{ basics.name }}</h1>
    <!-- It doesn't matter if you use wrapping spaces or not inside {{ }} -->
    <h2>{{basics.label}}</h2>
</section>
```
CSS styles could be inside `<style>` as well as Javascript code. A template is just a HTML with `{{ }}` that will be replaced with values from the `cv.json`.
##### Arrays
`cv.json` has arrays with objects. Like:
```json
{
    "basics": {
      "profiles": [{
        "network": "Twitter",
        "username": "john",
        "url": "http://twitter.com/john"
      }]
    }
}
```
To map array values, the syntax is:
```html
<!-- Point a key which value is an array -->
{! basics.profiles
    <!-- Note the number of braces here: { } not {{ }} -->
    <!-- Number of spaces inside { } also doesn't matter -->
    <div>{network}</div>
    <p>{username}</p>
    <a href="{url}">{url}</a>
!}
```

## Installing
#### Installing a crate
If you have Cargo installed, download [qcv crate](https://crates.io/crates/qcv) and use it globally in a terminal.
```sh
$ cargo install qcv
# Usage
$ qcv init
$ qcv build simple
```

#### Installing a binary
Download an archive in the [releases](https://github.com/SergChr/qcv/releases) section. E.g. for Ubuntu, download `...x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`, unpack it, then use as follows:
```sh
# Create a JSON template
./qcv init
# Generate HTML file
./qcv build simple
```

#### Cloning the repo
Use this method if you have Rust ecosystem installed.
```sh
$ git clone <repo>
# Create cv.json template
$ cargo run init

# Build cv.html result based on cv.json
$ cargo run build simple
```
